/***
 * In chapter 1 values types and operators were discussed
 *
 * values are stored in memory as data
 *
 * Numbers
 * numbers in javascript can be used to do arithmetic and many other things such as represent values for variables.
 *
 * Fractional numbers are written with a decimal and should not be trusted for accuracy
 *
 * exponents can be use with the 2.998e8 syntax which equals 2.998 *10^8
 *
 * All arithmetic can be used and follows the order of operations
 *
 * certain behaviors exists when javascript attempts to convert values from different types often these are unexpected outcomes
 *
 * SPECIAL NUMBERS
 * infinity and -infinity infinity calculations are suspect and should be avoided
 *
 * strings use ' " " or `` the last is a template literal and allows for logic to be entered into the string `${4+4}`
 *
 * Unary Operators are - typeof and !
 *
 * Binary operators are -+ etc
 *
 * booleans are tru or false
 *
 * undefined and null are similar and usually interchangable while nan is a nonsensical value and undefined is a value yet to be defined and null is an empty value
 *
 * this or that this || that
 *
 * this then that this&&that
